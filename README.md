# Threat-Detection-in-Amazon-CloudTrail-Logs
This project aims to guide you in enhancing threat detection within your AWS environment by exploring the anatomy of CloudTrail Events. It demonstrates how to leverage Amazon Athena's service for identifying unusual patterns, detecting potential security threats, and ensuring compliance.

## METHODS OF THREAT DETECTION IN YOUR AWS ENVIRONMENT
🕵️‍♂️ Behavior-Based Threat Detection in the AWS <br/>
🕵️‍♂️ Detecting Anomalies in CloudTrail with CloudWatch  <br/>
🕵️‍♂️ Detecting Anomalies using decoy  <br/>
🕵️‍♂️ Threat Detection with CloudTrail Insights
